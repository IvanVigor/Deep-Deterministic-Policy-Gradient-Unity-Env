# Project Report

This is a small reporta associate to the Deep Determinist Policy Gradient (DDPG) network developed for the Udacity virtual environment.

## Environment Introduction

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. The double-jointed arm will receive a reward  a reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

For this environment we used only single double-jointed arm. It has been studied that using multiple arms may reduce the training effort thanks to the [sharing of experience](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/10/how-robots-can-acquire-new-skills-from.html).
